# Lung-Cancer-Metastasis-Prediction

Project Title: Lung Cancer Metastasis Prediction using Ensemble Learning


Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. The early detection of Metastasis can be helpful in diagnosing the disease in different way, so the individual has a better chance of survival. Since Cancer has not been
completely eradicated, it is necessary to find the key causes of it. Medical tests are extremely expensive, so a cost-friendly way to carry out first level testing is essential.
The data being used for this project is the SEER Research Data, for which we have obtained a permit from the NCI ( National Cancer Institute ) to work on the data for any kind of analysis purposes. The Lung Cancer Detection
application has three main objectives, the first being finding the key attributes which contribute to a diagnosed patient’s survivability of Lung Cancer. Moreover, analysis of patients diagnosed with Lung Cancer from the SEER
data will be carried out. Secondly, our system will evaluate if the Cancer will spread to other parts of the body(Metastasis) for a patient based on his/her history. Our third objective is to predict the survival time of patient
diagnosed with Malignant Lung Cancer.  The Lung Cancer Detection application is a tool which performs analysis on a patient diagnosed with Lung Cancer in an intelligent way without the need of multiple tests. The web application
will take in details about the diagnosed patient’s history , and will then evaluate if an individual has a risk of Metastasis occuring, and will calculate the individual's survival time.
